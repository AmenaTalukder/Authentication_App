<br>Profile Management: Users can view and update their profile information.
<br>Responsive Design: Built with a clean, mobile-friendly interface.
<br>Secure Routing: Protected routes are only accessible to authenticated users.
<br>Form Validation: Client-side and server-side validation ensures data integrity.
<br>API Integration: Utilizes RESTful APIs for backend communication.
## Technologies Used:
<br>Frontend: React, React Router, Axios
<br>Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (for storing user data)
<br>Authentication: JWT, Bcrypt for password hashing
<br>UI Components: Styled with CSS/SCSS for a clean and modern look
<br>
## Future Enhancements:

Two-factor authentication (2FA)
Email verification for registration
